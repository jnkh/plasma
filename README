% This script is part of the
% Disruption Predictor Feature Developer tools.
% These scripts were developed to utilize
% Support Vector Machines to evaluate diagnostic
% signals as features for predicting disruptions

%
% The following scripts are part of the DPFD tool set:
%
% current_filter.m - identifies time where current first exceeds threshold
% d_analysis.m - analyzes disruptive shots using Support Vector Machines
% feature_extract.m - extracts features from signals
% feature_paths.m - gives directory paths for all features
% get_jet_data.m - extracts signal data from MDSPlus
% get_nstx_data.m - extracts signal data from MDSPlus
% nd_analysis.m - analyzes nondisruptive shots using Support Vector Machines
% plots.m - plots outputs of the SVM analysis
% setup.m - collects feature data to output into training/testing vectors
% signal_paths.m  - gives directory paths for all signals
% sig_norm.m - gets normalization info for signal
% stimes.m - identifies time intervals for shots
% test.m - performs the SVM analysis
% vars.m - specifies variables and initiates SVM analysis 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The following describes the general workflow from raw data to SVM results
%
% (1) Pull data from MDSPlus to /p/datad/signal_data (get_*_data.m)
% (2) Preprocess data (stimes.m, current_filter.m, sig_norm.m)
% (3) Extract features (feature_extract.m, derived_sig.m)
% (4) Setup feature vectors (setup.m)
% (5) SVM training/testing (vars.m)
